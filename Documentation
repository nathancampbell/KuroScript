The default memory allocated to a stupid program is 5 memory cells each being 4 bytes long.
this can only be changed at the beginning of the program with 
'_<the number of memory cells to be allocated>'

by default, each memory cell is filled with its cell number, eg. cell 2 contains the integer 2.

    incrementation:

    +<the cell to be incremented>)

    +3) <increments cell 3 by one>





    decrementation:

    +<the cell to be decremented>)

    +3) <decrements cell 3 by one>




    ASCII output:
    
    syntax: @<ASCII to be output>)
            @[<cell to be output as ASCII>)
    
    @Hello, World) <prints "Hello, World">
